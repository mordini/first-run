* Tasks: Setup Linux from Starter Scripts (run as root)
** DONE apt-get update, upgrade
** TODO remove not used repos 
** DONE install sudo
** DONE install linuxbrew essentials, (sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git m4 ruby texinfo libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat-dev libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev)
** DONE install other software (sudo apt-get checkinstall console-data tmux irssi)
*** more to come as we find more
** DONE setup new users, prompts, give sudo to?
** TODO prompt to install linuxbrew for users, retrieve list of users, multiple-select menu?
*** DONE have set this up as single-user install for now in add-users
*** will likely make a function to run the install linuxbrew commands as another user.
*** prompt to run as which user, then call command as runuser -l username -c ./install-linuxbrew (?)

* RUN AS USER (user of choice)
** DONE install linuxbrew (ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)")
** DONE export paths to .bashrc (unless used git environment? maybe have a 'starting' .bashrc)
*** DONE export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
*** DONE export MANPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH"
*** DONE export INFOPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH"
** DONE brew install emacs
** TODO use git to get user environment? this is probably better than exporting the paths for linuxbrew.
*** DONE use loadkeys to make Capslock CTRL at this point
**** CAN ALSO (Debian systems only! tested, go this route, keep an eye on loadkeys in case we want to do this for alt systems)
